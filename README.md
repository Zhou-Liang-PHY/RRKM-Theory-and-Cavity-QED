# RRKM-Theory-and-Cavity-QED
Slides Bridging RRKM kinetics with cavity QED: explained how lightâ€“matter coupling modifies the molecular Hamiltonian into polaritonic PES, thereby shifting effective barriers and density of states, which in turn alters RRKM/TST rates.

* First half: RRKM Theory

* Second half: A journal club covering 3 papers on how polaritonic vibrational strong coupling(VSC) effect the RRKM rate.
